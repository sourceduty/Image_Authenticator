It analyzes various aspects of an image to identify if it is a real photograph, a faked image, an AI-generated creation, or if it has been manipulated using software like Photoshop. The tool employs advanced techniques to scrutinize the image's metadata, detect inconsistencies, and identify telltale signs of manipulation or artificial generation. By leveraging a combination of algorithms and expert knowledge, 'Image Authenticator' provides a thorough and reliable analysis of the image's authenticity.

   - The image lacks EXIF metadata, which limits insights into its origin or the device used to capture it.

2. Error Level Analysis (ELA):
   - The ELA image does not show significant inconsistencies. The differences are mostly uniform, suggesting that the image has not been heavily edited or manipulated.

3. Visual Inspection:
   - The image appears realistic with natural elements, consistent lighting, and shadows.
   - The tracked dirt bike and the rider's gear look plausible for a real-world scenario.

4. AI Detection Tools:
   - There are no immediate signs indicating the image is AI-generated or digitally manipulated based on the available analysis tools.

Authenticity Rating:
- [x] Real
- [ ] Fake
